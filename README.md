# simple-bash-scripts

It occured to me that the most useful bash scripts I could possibly write are extremely simple, perhaps one liners that involve only a couple commands but usually with complicated options and arguments that require reference often enough. Typically these are scripts I only occasionally use, but when I do need them, the exact behaviour is easier to execute from these files. It's possible I will come to use some commands more than I do by making it easier to do so. Feel free to fork, contribute, make pull request. 

For now, this is a small repo, but I can see it becoming one of my important ones despite being very basic.
